## Docker advantages for Continuous Delivery 

- Faster - slow one time events happen only once on image creation, not on instance creation. Image creation is fast and cheap.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Better: Same images for development/testing/production. Portability and scalability. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Workflow: develop/ unit test Dockerfiles / commit / post-commit  hooks triggers new delivery / build new images from source/ the image is the software artifact / system tests run on these images. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Encourages collaboration between Dev and Ops.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Version Control of images.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Share or reuse Docker Hub images.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
