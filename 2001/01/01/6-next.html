# Next up: Kubernetes 

<!-- .slide: style="text-align: left;"> -->Concepts:

- Pod: groups of containers working in tandem
- Service: acts as a load balancer endpoint. 
- Storage: adresses some of the persistence problems using external storage.
- Fault tolerance: reallocates pods automatically in the case of a hardware failure.

Provides good abstractions to manage clusters of containers, but does not handle multi regions off the shelf, therefore requiring some fiddling.

# Openshift Origin

Openshift Origin is an opensource PaaS, which provides many of Deis features, a large ecossystem of pre-built applications and was recently redesigned to use kubernetes as its cluster management tool. 

Instalation method of choice is using ansible. But it's not a very smooth experience yet.
